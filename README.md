**Bidly** is an auction house application where users can register, log in, create and manage their listings and bid on other's listings. The application is built with **JavaScript (ES Modules), HTML and Tailwind CSS**, and interacts with the **Noroff Auction House API**.

- **Home** â€“ Main landing page with grid of all listings, with sort and search functionality.
- **Login** â€“ Allows users to sign into their account.

- **Single listing** - Displays a single listing with title, media gallery, description, seller information and bid history. Allows user to bid on the listing if it's not their own, or shows button to log in if the user is not logged in.
- **Profile** - Displays the user's profile with options to edit their profile information and create a new listing. Also shows the listings the user has active bids on, and the user's own listings. Allows the user to manage listings they have created.
